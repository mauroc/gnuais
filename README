The configuration can be found in the file gnuais.conf. GNU AIS looks for this file
first in the working directory, then /etc/gnuais.conf and then /usr/local/etc/gnuais.conf.
An alternative configuration file can be specified with the command line argument -c <filename>.
It is explained in gnuais.conf how you will have to edit it in order to fullfill your wishes.

You will also have to create a table in the database if the mysql option is desired:


Make new database (if needed) with command:
  mysqladmin create <databasename>

You can also use any existing database adding table 'ais':
  mysql <databasename>  < create_table.sql
  
Or if you have specified username and password for your database:
  mysql -u <username> -p <databasename>  < create_table.sql
  
 

The file create_table.sql can be found in this folder.

================================================================= my notes
11/20/2012

	compiled modified version of gnuais and got it to work with ais dispatcher

	cd ../gnuais
	git pull https://github.com/rubund/gnuais.git

	only filed I worked on was src/protodec.c. Basically commented out most of the printf statements

	to recompile:
	    	cmake .
    		make
    		sudo make install
	this creates an executable gnuais in /usr/local/bin. rename it to gnuais_mc

	the command for AISHub is

		gnuais_mc | aisdispatcher -i -G -H 87.121.76.11:2028,193.189.247.193:32161  (-G = debugger on)

		gnuais_mc -c gnuais_sql.conf | aisdispatcher -i -G -H 87.121.76.11:2028  (with sql tracking)

		run from /bbxais as you want to use the .conf files in that dir

	use rake db:drop in /bbxais to clear sql tabels periodically

11/17/2012
	created ruby app bbxais to send UDP packets since I coudl nto get aisdispatcher to work

every time machine is rebooted:

	- open up terminal
• cd bbxais
• gnuais
• open up new tab
• rails c

gnuais -c gnuais_test.conf to see segnal strength

Radio settings
• connect radio discriminator output to line-in in back of computer (blue, lower row)
• select channels 1 or 2 manual on radio. listen on build in speaker and adjust squelch until white noise is constant. Turn volume to minimum
• systems setting (top right gear symbol), sount, input tab
• select analog line in
• veryfy output volume slider is not on mute (output level seems to influence input sound level?). about 25% of the way seemed to work
• configure ~/gnuais/gnuais.conf if necessary (see below)
• launch /mauro/gnuais gnuais (gnuais | aisdispatcher -i -H data.aishub.net:2394 to send udp to aishub)
• adjust line in volume on Sound settings until level on Channel 1 or 0 is 60-80% (turn SoundLevelLog to 1 in cconf fileto see sound level)


gnuais > mauro.txt to generate dump

installed aisdispacther by downloading the linux version and extracting the executable, then placing it in /usr/bin

to create tables in mysql database:
	sudo mysql BBX_development  < create_table.sql
where create_table.sql is on github repo

gnuais.conf:
	mysql settings

mysql_host localhost
mysql_db BBX_development
mysql_user mauro
mysql_password peppino2011
mysql_keepsmall yes
mysql_oldlimit 800
